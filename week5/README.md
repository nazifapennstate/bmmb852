# Week 5: Obtain and visualise FASTQ data from SRA

I was assigned to Group 1, for which the paper was Gire et al. (2014), "Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak," published in  [_Science_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259657).

As outlined in the Acknowledgements section of the paper, the sequence data for this project are available at NCBI (NCBI BioGroup: PRJNA257197).

Under this bioproject, I picked a random strain (BioSample: SAMN03254248; Sample name: G5844.1; SRA: SRS803773) for all downstream analysis.
